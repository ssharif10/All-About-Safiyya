	<p>Hello!  My name is Safiyya!  I am from Atlanta, GA.  I currently work as a Supply Analyst for a woodworkings company.  My favorite things are music (I play the violin), watching movies, exercising, cooking/eating, and hanging with friends and family.  I am curretly enrolled in the GA Tech Coding Bootcamp.  It's very exciting!  I feel like I'm learning so much already.  I hope to be a very successful developer in the future.  Thank goodness I took those classes on Code Academy.  They really helped!  I think the future is going to be very bright.</p>
